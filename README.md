## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This project is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database.

The technologies used in this application are:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) to prompt the user
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to store the data
* [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to the MySQL database from Node.js
* [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console
* [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to store environmental variables
